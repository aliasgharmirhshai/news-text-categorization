# Text Classification for News Categories using Random Forest Classifier

## Project Overview
 
 classify news articles into predefined categories (e.g., business, politics, sport, etc.) based on their content.

 ## Steps Involved

1 - Data Exploration : 

Distribution of news categories, world cloud

2 - Text Preprocessing : 

* Convert text to lowercase to avoid duplicating information due to case sensitivity.
* Remove punctuation using regular expressions.
* Tokenize the text into individual words.
* Remove stopwords using NLTK's predefined list of stopwords.
* Stemming the words using Porter Stemmer to reduce words to their root form (e.g., "running" becomes "run").
* Lemmatization to convert words to their base form using the WordNet Lemmatizer.
* Encoding Categorical Variables

3 - Modeling 

* Random Forest Classifier
* Model Evaluation by Confusion Matrix
